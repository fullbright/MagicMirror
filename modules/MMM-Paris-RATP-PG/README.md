# specific configuration
 [name]: [default value], //information
 maximumEntries: 2, //if the APIs sends several results for the incoming transport how many should be displayed
 updateInterval: 60000, //time in ms between pulling request for new times (update request)
 converToWaitingTime: true, // messages received from API can be 'hh:mm' in that case convert it in the waiting time 'x mn'
 maxLeterrsForDestination: 22, //will limit the length of the destination string
 concatenateArrivals: true, //if for a transport there is the same destination and several times, they will be displayed on one line
 showSecondsToNextUpdate: true, // display a countdown to the next update pull (should I wait for a refresh before going ?)
 showLastUpdateTime: false, //display the time when the last pulled occured (taste & color...)
 oldUpdateOpacity: 0.5, //when a displayed time age has reached a threshold their display turns darker (i.e. less reliable)
 oldThreshold: 0.1, //if (1+x) of the updateInterval has passed since the last refresh... then the oldUpdateOpacity is applied
 debug: false, //console.log more things to help debugging
 busStations: [] // the list of stations/directions to monitor (bus and RERs, probably works also for Subways)
 
 busStations is an array of objects with four properties:
  - type: 'bus', 'rers'
  - line: 28, 'B' -> typically the official name but you can check through: 
   . https://api-ratp.pierre-grimaud.fr/v2/bus/
   . https://api-ratp.pierre-grimaud.fr/v2/rers/
  - stations: the station id, look it up with the url, typically: https://api-ratp.pierre-grimaud.fr/v2/{type}/{line}
  - destination: the destination id (indicated in the same look up url)
  - 'label': optional: to rename the line differently if needed
